## My first Blog
Hey in there, this is my first blog.

I have just watched a video about [gap year on Youtube](https://youtu.be/SsuQA3-__WU) and came up with plenty of thoughts. There is something I want to write down. It's about the reason **why I chose to take a gap year** and **the time I got in great trouble with pressure from both inside and outside of myself**.

### Hard time of mine
It was a hard time when I chose to take this year out. I was under great pressure at that time with numerous work and addtionally the pressure from my mind.

I was once totally in a belief that I'll go to the US for my Master degree after graduation. 
> US's college education is the best in the world, you gotta join in that if you want to be an elite.
That's what I once told myself. I choose CS to be my major for some reason, maybe because once listened to a special column of Jun Wu, a famous computer engineer graduated from Tsinghua University and got his PhD degree in Johns Hopkins University. I didn't know much about industry and science at that time, Jun Wu's column gave me a direct view to the beauty of science and especically computer science. I came to know about how computer works and why CS is the most useful subject at present. As a result, I determined to go to US for CS PhD, and that was really hard for me.

I came up to a route to achieve my goal. *First, change my major to CS.* However, in HUST, it's not an easy thing to change major, especially to CS, for there are so many students struggling to major in that. I went to ask my tutor for advice. She said that if I'm really determined, I can degrade in order to take the major changing exam. I spent a week asking my senior students who had changed their major for help. They told me their experiences and encourged me to do what I decided to do.

Nervously, I came to the office of the dean of CS college to ask him. Standing there for half an hour listening to him analyse pros and cons for me, I got confused. However, I couldn't show my confusion at that time.
