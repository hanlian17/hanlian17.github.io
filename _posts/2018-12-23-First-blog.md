## Hey in there, this is my first blog.
#### I have just watched a video about [gap year on Youtube](https://youtu.be/SsuQA3-__WU) and came up with plenty of thoughts. There is something I want to write down.
It's about the reason **why I chose to take a gap year** and **the time I got in great trouble with pressure from both inside and outside of myself**.

### The hard time that I nearly broke down.
It was a hard time when I chose to take this year out. I was under great pressure at that time with numerous work and addtionally the pressure from my mind.
I was once totally in a belief that I'll go to the US for my Master degree after graduation. >US's college education is the best in the world, you gotta join in that if you want to be an elite.
That's what I once told myself. I choose CS to be my major for some reason, maybe because once listened to a special column of Jun Wu, a famous computer engineer graduated from Tsinghua University and took his PhD degree in Johns Hopkins University. I didn't know much about industry and science at that time, Jun Wu's column gave me a direct view to the beauty of science and especically computer science.
